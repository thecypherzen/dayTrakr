## Overview

**Day Trakr** is a simple todo demo application built with `react`.
It's a practice project built while learning `react`.

It begins with very few features, but promises to be improved upon as time goes on, consolidating on knowledge growth in React, Javascript and other technologies, as the case may be.

Data is persited to browser local storage at the beginning, pending when the database persistence would be rolled out.
